Hi,

This repository is my actual dotfiles to work in openbox under Debian.

I will do it by steps to make it easy.

# Install openbox in a new environment

The packages are:

- [openbox](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/openbox)
- [openbox-menu](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/openbox-menu)
- [tint2](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/tint2)

# Additional packages

If you want to have a volume icon in tint2 you may to install:

- [volumeicon-alsa](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/volumeicon-alsa)

I tried VIM but I am looking for anything simplier, here it goes:

- [micro](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/micro)

A clipboard is important too:

- [xfce4-clipman](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/xfce4-clipman)
